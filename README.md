## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Groupie tracker search bar consists of creating a functional program that searches, inside your website, for a specific text input. So the focus of this project is to create a way for the client to search a member or artist or any other attribute in the data system you made.


###  Description

Instructions
    

    The program should handle at least these search cases :
        artist/band name
        members
        locations
        first album date
        creation date
    The program must handle search input as case-insensitive.
    The search bar must have typing suggestions as you write.
        The search bar must identify and display in each suggestion the individual type of the search cases. (ex: Freddie Mercury -> member)
        For example if you start writing "phil" it should appear as suggestions Phil Collins - member and Phil Collins - artist/band. This is just an example of a display.


    The program must be written in Go.
    The code must respect the good practices.
